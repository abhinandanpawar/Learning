# 11 - The Java Memory Model: The Rules of Concurrency

The Java Memory Model (JMM) is one of the most advanced and critical parts of the Java platform. It is the specification that defines the rules for how threads interact with memory. Understanding the JMM is essential for writing correct, high-performance concurrent code.

## 1. The Problem: Caches, Reordering, and a Lack of Guarantees

In a modern computer, code doesn't just run on a single CPU. There are multiple levels of caches, and both the compiler and the CPU can reorder instructions to optimize performance. In a single-threaded world, you never notice this. In a multi-threaded world, it can lead to two major problems:

1.  **Visibility:** A change made by one thread to a shared variable might not be visible to other threads immediately (or ever!). Each CPU core might have its own cached copy of the data.
2.  **Reordering:** Instructions can be executed in a different order than you wrote them in your code, leading to unexpected behavior.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph CPU 1
        C1[Cache: x=1]
    end
    subgraph CPU 2
        C2[Cache: x=0]
    end
    subgraph Main Memory
        M[x=0]
    end

    T1(Thread 1 on CPU 1) -- writes x=1 --> C1
    T2(Thread 2 on CPU 2) -- reads x --> C2
    C1 -.-> M
    C2 <-.-> M

    note for T2 "Reads stale data!"
```

Without the JMM, there would be no guarantee that the `x=1` write from Thread 1 would ever become visible to Thread 2.

## 2. The Solution: The "Happens-Before" Guarantee

The JMM provides a formal guarantee called **happens-before**. It's a simple rule:
> If action A *happens-before* action B, then the results of A are guaranteed to be visible to and ordered before B.

Several things create a happens-before relationship:
*   **A `synchronized` lock release on a monitor *happens-before* every subsequent acquire of that same monitor.** This is why `synchronized` works for both mutual exclusion and visibility.
*   **A write to a `volatile` variable *happens-before* every subsequent read of that same variable.**
*   Calling `thread.start()` *happens-before* any action in the started thread.
*   A thread finishing its work *happens-before* another thread successfully returns from a `thread.join()` call.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Thread 1: synchronized(lock){ x=1 }] --> B(Thread 1: releases lock)
    B -- happens-before --> C(Thread 2: acquires lock)
    C --> D[Thread 2: reads x (guaranteed to see 1)]
```

## 3. The `volatile` Keyword: A Lightweight Guarantee

The `volatile` keyword is a weaker form of synchronization. It does **not** provide mutual exclusion (locking), but it **does** provide a visibility guarantee.

When you declare a variable `volatile`, you are telling the JVM:
1.  Every write to this variable must be flushed directly to main memory.
2.  Every read of this variable must come directly from main memory, not a CPU cache.
3.  The compiler and CPU are forbidden from reordering instructions around reads and writes of this variable.

**When to use it:**
Use `volatile` when one thread writes to a variable, and other threads only read it. It's perfect for things like a status flag.

```java
class Worker {
    private volatile boolean stopped = false;

    public void run() {
        while (!stopped) {
            // do work
        }
        System.out.println("Worker thread stopped.");
    }

    public void stop() {
        // This write is guaranteed to be visible to the reading thread.
        this.stopped = true;
    }
}
```
Without `volatile`, the `run()` method's loop might never see the change to `stopped` and could loop forever.

## 4. Memory Model vs. Memory Structure

It's important not to confuse the Java Memory Model with Java's memory structure.
*   **Memory Structure:** This is *what* memory looks like. It's the division of memory into the **Stack**, **Heap**, and **Metaspace**. This is about where data is stored.
*   **Java Memory Model (JMM):** This is the set of *rules* that govern how threads interact with that memory structure. It's about visibility, ordering, and the guarantees the JVM provides.
