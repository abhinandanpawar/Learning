## The Left Page: A Picture of Alice and Her Apples

**(Imagine a picture here of a girl named Alice smiling, holding a basket with 5 red apples.)**

### The Code Spell

Java the Wizard says: "Let's teach the computer to remember how many apples Alice has. Here's the magic spell:"

```java
int numberOfApples = 5;
```

## The Right Page: The Story of the Code

### 1. The Story

Alice has a basket of apples. She wants to remember that she has **5** apples. We need to give this number a name so we can use it later. We'll call it `numberOfApples`.

### 2. The Code Explained

*   `int`: This is a special keyword that tells Java we're storing a whole number (an integer).
*   `numberOfApples`: This is the name we chose for our variable. It's like a label on a box.
*   `=`: This is the assignment operator. It means "put the value on the right into the box on the left".
*   `5`: This is the value we're storing.
*   `;`: Every spell in Java ends with a semicolon. It's like the period at the end of a sentence.

### 3. Under the Hood: Inside the JVM House

Java the Wizard says: "When you cast this spell, something magical happens inside the **JVM House**!"

1.  We go to the **Upstairs Room** (the **Method Stack**).
2.  We find a new, empty suitcase.
3.  We put a label on the suitcase that says `numberOfApples`.
4.  Inside the suitcase, we write the number `5`.

**(Imagine a cartoon picture of a room with a suitcase. The suitcase has a label "numberOfApples" and the number 5 is inside it.)**

This suitcase will stay in the Upstairs Room as long as we are in the current part of our story.

### Your First Experiment!

**Predict:** What happens if Alice eats one apple? What would the new code spell be?

**Run:** Try it out in an online Java sandbox!

**Reflect:** Draw a picture of the `numberOfApples` suitcase now. What number is inside it?
