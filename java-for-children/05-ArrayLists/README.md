# Chapter 5: ArrayLists - A Shopping Cart for Your Things

## The Left Page: A Picture of a Shopping Cart

**(Imagine a picture here of a shopping cart that can hold many different items.)**

### The Code Spell

Java the Wizard says: "Arrays are great, but they have a fixed size. What if you don't know how many items you need to store? For that, we have the **ArrayList**. It's like a magic shopping cart that grows as you add more things to it!"

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

// An ArrayList to hold our Robot objects
ArrayList<Robot> myRobots = new ArrayList<>();

// Add robots to the list
myRobots.add(new Robot("Robby"));
myRobots.add(new Robot("Rosie"));
```

## The Right Page: The Story of the Code

### 1. The Story

We want to create a list of all our robots, but we don't know how many robots we'll build. An `ArrayList` is perfect for this. It's a list that can grow and shrink as we need it to.

### 2. The Code Explained

*   `import java.util.ArrayList;`: The `ArrayList` is part of Java's "Collections Framework", a set of tools for working with groups of objects. We need to `import` it to use it.
*   `ArrayList<Robot>`: This creates a new `ArrayList`. The `<Robot>` part tells the `ArrayList` that it will only hold `Robot` objects. This is called **Generics**, and it helps us avoid mistakes.
*   `myRobots.add(...)`: We use the `add` method to add a new robot to our list.

### 3. Under the Hood: Inside the JVM House

Java the Wizard says: "An `ArrayList` is a clever trick. It's actually using an array in the **Downstairs Toy Box** (the **Heap**), but it hides the messy details from you!"

1.  The `ArrayList` object is created on the **Heap**. It contains a small array inside it (maybe with 10 slots to start).
2.  When you `add` an item, it puts it in the next available slot in the array.
3.  What happens when the array is full? The `ArrayList` performs a magic trick: it creates a **new, bigger array**, copies all the items from the old array to the new one, and then throws away the old array. The **Robot Vacuum** (the **Garbage Collector**) then cleans up the old array.

**(Imagine a cartoon picture of the ArrayList object in the Heap. It has a small array inside. Then, show a picture of it creating a bigger array and copying the items over.)**

### Your Next Experiment!

**Predict:** Can you use a `for` loop to say hello to all the robots in your `myRobots` list?

**Run:** Try it out in an online Java sandbox!

**Reflect:** What do you think is the trade-off of using an `ArrayList`? (Hint: think about what happens when it has to resize).
