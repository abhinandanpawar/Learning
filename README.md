## A Note on Diagrams

Some of the notes in this repository use Mermaid to render diagrams. If you are not seeing diagrams, you may need to use a markdown viewer or browser extension that supports Mermaid.

### Rendering Diagrams Locally

To render the diagrams locally, you can use the `render_mermaid.sh` script. This script uses the `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` tool to convert the Mermaid diagrams in a Markdown file into SVGs and embeds them in a new Markdown file.

First, make sure you have the dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the script with the input file path. The output file path is optional.

```bash
./render_mermaid.sh <input_file.md> [output_file.md]
```

If the output file path is not provided, it will be generated by appending `_with_diagrams` to the input file name.

For example:

```bash
./render_mermaid.sh java-notes/12-System-Design-with-Java/README.md
```

This will create a new file, `java-notes/12-System-Design-with-Java/README_with_diagrams.md`, with the Mermaid diagrams rendered as SVGs.
