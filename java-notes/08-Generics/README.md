# 08 - Generics: Writing Type-Safe Code

For the first few years of Java's life, we had a problem. When you put an object into a collection, it was treated as a generic `Object`. When you took it out, you had to cast it back to its original type. This was clumsy and, worse, it was not type-safe.

```java
// Pre-Java 5
List list = new ArrayList();
list.add("hello");
String s = (String) list.get(0); // Requires a cast
```

If you accidentally put the wrong type of object into the list, you wouldn't find out until runtime, when your program would crash with a `ClassCastException`. We knew we had to do better.

## 1. Our Solution: Generics

In Java 5, we introduced **Generics**. Generics allow you to have "type parameters" for your classes and methods. This means you can create a class or method that can work with any type, in a type-safe way.

With generics, you can tell the compiler what type of objects a collection is supposed to hold.

```java
// Java 5 and later
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("hello");
String s = list.get(0); // No cast needed!
```

Now, if you try to add a non-String object to this list, the compiler will give you an error. We moved the error from runtime to compile-time, which was a huge win for robustness.

**JVM Deep Dive: Type Erasure**

This might surprise you, but the JVM doesn't actually know about generics. We implemented generics using a technique called **type erasure**. The compiler uses the generic type information to check for type errors at compile-time, but then it erases the generic type information and replaces it with casts.

We chose this approach to maintain backward compatibility with older versions of Java that didn't have generics. It was a pragmatic trade-off.

## 2. Generics in Our E-commerce App

In our e-commerce app, we can use generics to create a type-safe shopping cart.

```java
List<Product> shoppingCart = new ArrayList<>();
```

This ensures that our shopping cart can only hold `Product` objects (or subclasses of `Product`), preventing us from accidentally adding, say, a `User` object to the cart.

## Interview Deep Dives

### Q31: How are Generics implemented in Java? What is Type Erasure?

*   **Simple Answer:** Generics are a compile-time feature. The compiler checks for type safety, but then "erases" the generic type information. This is called Type Erasure.
*   **Detailed Explanation:**
    *   When you write `List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();`, the compiler checks to make sure you only add `String`s to it. This prevents `ClassCastException`s at runtime.
    *   After this check, the compiler erases the `<String>` part. The bytecode that the JVM runs just sees a raw `List`. When you get an element out, the compiler secretly adds a cast for you.
*   **Why was it done this way?** For backward compatibility. When Generics were added in Java 5, this allowed new generic code to work with old code that didn't use generics.
*   **Key Consequence:** You cannot get the generic type information (like `<String>`) at runtime. It's gone.
