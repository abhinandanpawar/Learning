# 14 - Modern Java in Action: A Tour of Recent Features

Java is constantly evolving. Since Java 9, a new version is released every six months, with a **Long-Term Support (LTS)** version released every two years. This chapter highlights the most impactful features from recent LTS releases that you will use in modern, professional Java development.

**What's in this chapter:**
*   [Java 11 (LTS): Convenience and a New HTTP Client](#1-java-11-lts)
*   [Java 17 (LTS): Data Modeling and Pattern Matching](#2-java-17-lts)
*   [Java 21 (LTS): The Concurrency Revolution](#3-java-21-lts)
*   [Hands-On Lab: A Modern Features Showcase](#4-hands-on-lab-a-modern-features-showcase)

## 1. Java 11 (LTS)

#### `var` for Local Variable Type Inference
The `var` keyword lets you declare a local variable without explicitly writing its type. The compiler *infers* the type from the right-hand side of the expression. This reduces boilerplate and improves readability.

*   **Before:** `Map<String, List<User>> userMap = new HashMap<>();`
*   **After:** `var userMap = new HashMap<String, List<User>>();`

#### New `String` and `Files` Methods
A number of quality-of-life methods were added.
*   `" ".isBlank()`: Checks if a string is empty or contains only white space.
*   `" line1 \n line2 ".lines()`: Returns a stream of lines.
*   `Files.writeString(path, content)` and `Files.readString(path)`: Simplified file I/O.

#### Standard `HttpClient`
Java 11 introduced a new, modern, and fluent API for making HTTP requests, replacing the old `HttpURLConnection`. It supports HTTP/2 and asynchronous operations.

---

## 2. Java 17 (LTS)

#### `records`: Immutable Data Carriers
Records provide a concise syntax for creating immutable data classes. The compiler automatically generates the constructor, getters, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.

*   **Before:** A 50-line class with fields, a constructor, getters, etc.
*   **After:** `public record User(String id, String name) {}`

#### `sealed` Classes and Interfaces
Sealed classes give you fine-grained control over which other classes can extend or implement them. This is powerful when you want to model a closed set of possibilities (e.g., in a domain model).

```java
// Only Circle and Square are allowed to implement Shape.
public sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Square { ... }
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    Shape -- permits --> Circle
    Shape -- permits --> Square
    Rectangle -- "Compile Error" --> Shape
```

#### Pattern Matching for `instanceof`
Reduces boilerplate by combining a type check and a cast.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Before: Manual Check and Cast"
        A{obj instanceof String?} -- Yes --> B["String s = (String) obj<br/><i>(explicit cast)</i>"];
        B --> C("Use s");
    end

    subgraph "After: Pattern Matching"
        E{obj instanceof String s} -- Yes --> F("Use s directly<br/><i>(no cast needed)</i>");
    end
```

*   **Before:**
    ```java
    if (obj instanceof String) {
        String s = (String) obj;
        // ... use s
    }
    ```
*   **After:**
    ```java
    if (obj instanceof String s) {
        // ... use s directly
    }
    ```

#### Switch Expressions
Modernized `switch` to be a concise, safe expression that returns a value.

*   **Before:**
    ```java
    switch(day) {
        case MONDAY: result = 1; break;
        // ...
    }
    ```
*   **After:**
    ```java
    int result = switch(day) {
        case MONDAY -> 1;
        // ...
    };
    ```

## 3. Java 21 (LTS)

#### Virtual Threads (Project Loom)
This is a game-changing feature that dramatically simplifies writing high-throughput concurrent applications. Virtual threads are extremely lightweight threads managed by the JVM, allowing you to have millions of them.

*   **Before:** Use a complex, asynchronous, callback-based style to handle many concurrent I/O operations.
*   **After:** Write simple, synchronous, "thread-per-request" style code, and let virtual threads handle the scalability.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Traditional Model: Platform Threads"
        direction LR
        R1(Request 1) --> PT1(Platform Thread 1)
        PT1 -- "Blocks on I/O" --> Idle1(Thread is Idle)
        R2(Request 2) --> PT2(Platform Thread 2)
        PT2 -- "Blocks on I/O" --> Idle2(Thread is Idle)
        R3(Request 3) --> Blocked(No available thread)
    end

    subgraph "Modern Model: Virtual Threads"
        direction LR
        subgraph "JVM"
            VT1(VT 1)
            VT2(VT 2)
            VT3(VT 3)
            VT1 & VT2 & VT3 --> Carrier(Carrier Thread)
        end
        Carrier --> OS(OS Thread)

        Req1(Request 1) --> VT1
        Req2(Request 2) --> VT2
        Req3(Request 3) --> VT3

        note for Carrier "JVM maps many Virtual Threads onto a few OS threads."
    end
```

#### Sequenced Collections
New interfaces (`SequencedCollection`, `SequencedSet`, `SequencedMap`) were added to provide a unified API for accessing the first and last elements of a collection and for reversing the collection's order.

## Modern Java in Action: Stream API Examples

The Stream API, introduced in Java 8, is one of the most significant additions to the language. It provides a powerful way to process collections of data in a declarative, functional style. Let's look at a few examples of common operations.

### Example 1: `reduce` to Summarize Data

**User Question:** How can I sum two numbers using the Stream API?

**Answer:** Of course! Let's put the pieces together.
The correct code is:
`Stream.of(num1, num2).reduce(0, Integer::sum);`

Let's break that down:
 * `Stream.of(num1, num2)`: This part creates a stream that contains your two numbers.
 * `.reduce()`: This is the terminal operation that will produce a single result.
 * `0`: This is the **identity**, or the starting value. Our sum starts at 0 before we add anything.
 * `Integer::sum`: This is a **method reference** that tells `reduce` how to combine the numbers. It's a neat shortcut for writing the lambda `(total, number) -> total + number`.

Here‚Äôs how the computer sees it:
1. Start with the total as `0`.
2. Take the first number from the stream (`num1`) and add it to the total. Total is now `0 + num1`.
3. Take the next number (`num2`) and add it to the total. Total is now `(0 + num1) + num2`.
4. The stream is empty, so the final result is the total.

That was a tricky one to start with because it's not a typical use for streams, but you did a great job figuring out that `reduce` was the key!

### Example 2: Lambda vs. Method Reference

**User Question:** What is the `::` syntax?

**Answer:** You're very close! The `::` syntax is related to lambda expressions, but it has its own specific name: a **method reference**.
Think of it this way: a method reference is a shorthand for a lambda expression that just calls a single, existing method.

Here's a simple breakdown of the difference:
 * **Lambda Expression (`->`)**: You write out the instructions. It's like giving someone a recipe.
   * Example: `word -> word.length()`
   * In English: "Take the variable `word` and return the result of `word.length()`."
 * **Method Reference (`::`)**: You refer to an existing recipe by its name.
   * Example: `String::length`
   * In English: "Use the `length` method from the `String` class."

The great thing is that they can be used interchangeably in many cases, but the method reference is often cleaner and easier to read. You're pointing directly to the method you want to use. üëç

### Example 3: `String::length` Deep Dive

Let's look at `String::length` more closely. It's a method reference. It's a shorthand way of writing a lambda expression that does nothing but call a single, existing method. Think of it as a direct pointer to the `length()` method of the `String` class.

#### The Breakdown
The double colon `::` is the operator that creates a method reference.
 * **`String`** (left side): This is the class (or object) that contains the method.
 * **`length`** (right side): This is the name of the method you want to call.

When you use `.map(String::length)`, the Java compiler understands the following:
 * The `.map()` operation is working on a stream of `String` objects.
 * It needs a function that takes a `String` as input.
 * `String::length` points to a method that takes no arguments but operates on a `String` instance and returns an `int`.
 * The compiler automatically maps each `String` object from the stream to the `length()` method call on that object.

#### Side-by-Side Comparison
Using a method reference is often cleaner and more readable than writing out the full lambda expression.

**Lambda Version:**
```java
List<Integer> lengths = words.stream()
                             .map(word -> word.length()) // Explicitly define the lambda
                             .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

**Method Reference Version:**
```java
List<Integer> lengths = words.stream()
                             .map(String::length) // Point directly to the method
                             .collect(Collectors.toList());
```
Both versions do the exact same thing. The method reference `String::length` is simply a more concise and expressive way to write `word -> word.length()`.

### 6 Common Use Cases for the Java Stream API

Here are several common use cases for the Java Stream API, ranging from simple data manipulation to more complex operations.

**1. Filtering a Collection**
This is one of the most basic uses. You can easily select items from a list that meet a certain condition.
*Use Case:* From a list of products, find all the products that are on sale.
```java
List<Product> cheapProducts = allProducts.stream()
    .filter(product -> product.isOnSale())
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

**2. Transforming Data (Mapping)**
You often need to convert a list of one type of object into a list of another type. `map` is perfect for this.
*Use Case:* You have a list of `User` objects, but you only need a list of their email addresses.
```java
List<String> userEmails = users.stream()
    .map(User::getEmail) // Uses a method reference
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

**3. Finding a Specific Item**
Streams provide an efficient way to search for an element without writing a manual loop.
*Use Case:* Find the first user in a list whose username is "admin". This returns an `Optional`, which safely handles cases where no match is found.
```java
Optional<User> adminUser = users.stream()
    .filter(user -> "admin".equals(user.getUsername()))
    .findFirst();
```

**4. Grouping Data**
This is a very powerful feature. You can group a list of objects into a `Map` based on a specific property.
*Use Case:* Group a list of employees by their department.
```java
Map<Department, List<Employee>> employeesByDept = employees.stream()
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment));
```

**5. Performing Calculations on Data**
Streams make it easy to perform aggregate calculations on collections of numbers.
*Use Case:* From a list of transactions, calculate the total revenue.
```java
double totalRevenue = transactions.stream()
    .mapToDouble(Transaction::getAmount)
    .sum();
```

**6. Joining Strings**
You can easily combine a list of strings into a single, formatted string.
*Use Case:* Create a single, comma-separated string from a list of tags.
```java
String tagString = tags.stream()
    .filter(tag -> !tag.isEmpty())
    .collect(Collectors.joining(", ")); // Result: "Java, Stream, API"
```
