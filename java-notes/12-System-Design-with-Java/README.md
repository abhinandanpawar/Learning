# 12 - System Design with Java

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.

## 1. Common Architectural Patterns

### a. Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic architecture is a traditional model where an application is built as a single, unified unit.

*   **Pros:** Simple to develop, test, and deploy.
*   **Cons:** Difficult to scale, maintain, and update. A single point of failure.

Java has been used for decades to build monolithic applications, often using frameworks like Java EE (now Jakarta EE).

### b. Microservices Architecture

A microservices architecture is an approach where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates with other services over a network.

*   **Pros:** Scalable, flexible, and easier to maintain.
*   **Cons:** Complex to manage, requires a mature DevOps culture.

Java is a popular choice for building microservices, with frameworks like Spring Boot and Quarkus making it easy to create and deploy standalone services.

### c. Event-Driven Architecture

An event-driven architecture is a software architecture paradigm promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events.

This pattern is often used in modern, distributed systems to enable loose coupling and high scalability. Java is well-suited for event-driven systems, with libraries and frameworks like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Akka.

## 2. Key Considerations in System Design

*   **Scalability:** The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work.
*   **Reliability:** The ability of a system to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time.
*   **Availability:** The probability that a system will be operational at a given time.

## 3. Java's Role in System Design

Java is an excellent choice for building large-scale, high-performance systems for several reasons:

*   **Maturity and Stability:** Java has been around for over 25 years and is known for its stability and reliability.
*   **Performance:** The JVM's JIT compiler and advanced garbage collectors provide excellent performance.
*   **Rich Ecosystem:** A vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools.
*   **Concurrency Support:** Built-in support for multithreading and concurrency, which is essential for building scalable systems.
*   **Platform Independence:** The WORA principle allows Java applications to run on any platform with a JVM.
