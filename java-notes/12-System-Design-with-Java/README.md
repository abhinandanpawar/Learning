# 12 - System Design with Java: Building Large-Scale Systems

We designed Java to build robust, large-scale systems. This chapter explores *why* Java is an excellent choice for system design and provides a framework for thinking about architectural problems, particularly in the context of a technical interview.

## 1. Why Java for System Design?
*   **The JVM:** A high-performance, observable, and portable runtime. Advanced GCs and JIT compilers provide a solid foundation.
*   **Strong Typing:** Catches entire classes of errors at compile-time, leading to more reliable systems.
*   **Concurrency:** Mature and powerful concurrency features are essential for scalable applications.
*   **The Ecosystem:** The vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and frameworks (Spring, Hibernate, etc.) is arguably Java's greatest strength.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "The Java Ecosystem"
        A(Core Java Platform)
        A --> B(Language)
        A --> C(JVM)
        A --> D(Core Libraries)

        subgraph "Tooling"
            E(Build Tools<br>Maven, Gradle)
            F(IDEs<br>IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode)
        end

        subgraph "Frameworks"
            G(Spring)
            H(Quarkus)
            I(Hibernate)
            J(and many more...)
        end

        A -- enables --> E
        A -- enables --> F
        A -- enables --> G
        A -- enables --> H
        A -- enables --> I
        A -- enables --> J
    end
```

## 2. Architectural Evolution: Monolith to Microservices

A common path for a successful system is to evolve from a simple monolith to a more complex but scalable microservice architecture.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Phase 1: Monolith"
        direction LR
        U1(User) --> LB1(Load Balancer)
        LB1 --> S1(Monolith Server)
        S1 --> DB1(Database)
    end

    subgraph "Phase 2: Microservices"
        direction LR
        U2(User) --> LB2(API Gateway)
        LB2 --> US(UserService) --> UDB(User DB)
        LB2 --> PS(ProductService) --> PDB(Product DB)
        LB2 --> OS(OrderService) --> ODB(Order DB)
    end

    U1 -- evolves to --> U2
```
Java is well-suited for both styles. The Spring Framework, for example, can be used to build both large monoliths and distributed microservices.

## 3. A Framework for System Design Interviews

System design interviews test your ability to handle ambiguity and make reasoned trade-offs. Following a structured approach is key.

#### Step 1: Clarify Requirements (Functional & Non-Functional)
This is the most important step.
*   **Functional:** What must the system do? (e.g., "Design a URL shortener.")
*   **Non-Functional:** What are the constraints? Ask about **scale**.
    *   How many users? How many requests per second (RPS)?
    *   Read vs. Write ratio? (e.g., 100:1 read-to-write)
    *   Latency requirements? (e.g., p99 < 200ms)
    *   Availability requirements? (e.g., 99.99%)

#### Step 2: High-Level Design (The Whiteboard Sketch)
Draw the main components. Start simple and add complexity as needed.
```mermaid
graph TD
    User --> LB(Load Balancer)
    LB --> WebServers(Web Server Fleet)
    WebServers --> AppServers(App Server Fleet)
    AppServers --> Cache(Distributed Cache<br>e.g., Redis)
    AppServers --> DB(Database)
    Cache --> DB
```

#### Step 3: Deep Dive into a Component
The interviewer will guide you. Be prepared to discuss:
*   **Database Choice:** SQL vs. NoSQL? Why? (e.g., "I'll use PostgreSQL because we need ACID transactions, but I'll use read replicas to scale reads.")
*   **Data Schema:** How would you design the tables/documents?
*   **API Design:** What would the REST or gRPC endpoints look like?
*   **Scaling Strategy:** How will you handle more load? (e.g., "We can shard the database by `user_id` to distribute the write load.")

#### Step 4: Articulate Trade-offs
Always explain the "why" behind your decisions and acknowledge the downsides.
*   "I'm adding a cache to reduce latency, but the trade-off is that we now have to handle potential data inconsistency and cache invalidation."
*   "I'm choosing microservices for scalability and team autonomy, but the trade-off is a massive increase in operational complexity."

## 4. Key Architectural Patterns

Mentioning these patterns shows you are familiar with established solutions.

#### Hexagonal / Clean Architecture
Protect your core business logic from external details. The core defines "ports" (interfaces), and external tech (web frameworks, databases) are "adapters".
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Adapters
        A(Web Adapter)
        B(Database Adapter)
    end
    subgraph Application
        P1(Port)
        P2(Port)
    end
    subgraph Domain
        C(Core Business Logic)
    end
    A -- calls --> P1
    P1 -- implemented by --> C
    C -- calls --> P2
    P2 -- implemented by --> B
```

#### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Separate the "write" model (Commands) from the "read" model (Queries). Useful for systems with very different read/write patterns.
```mermaid
graph LR
    User --> CommandAPI(Command API) --> WriteModel(Write DB)
    WriteModel -- syncs --> ReadModel(Read DB)
    User --> QueryAPI(Query API) --> ReadModel
```

#### Circuit Breaker
A proxy that protects your application from cascading failures when calling a dependency.
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed: Healthy
    Closed --> Open: Failures exceed threshold
    Open --> Half_Open: After timeout
    Half_Open --> Closed: Success
    Half_Open --> Open: Failure
```
Use a library like **Resilience4j**.
