# 13 - The Java Ecosystem

The Java ecosystem is a vast collection of tools, libraries, and frameworks that make Java a powerful and versatile language.

## 1. Build Tools

Build tools are used to automate the process of building a software project, including compiling source code, managing dependencies, and running tests.

*   **Maven:** A popular build automation tool that uses a declarative XML file (`pom.xml`) for configuration.
*   **Gradle:** A more modern build tool that uses a Groovy-based DSL for configuration. It offers more flexibility and often better performance than Maven.

## 2. Web Frameworks

Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications.

*   **Spring Framework:** A comprehensive framework for building Java applications. The Spring Boot project makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
*   **Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE):** A set of specifications that provides a platform for building enterprise-level applications.

## 3. ORM Frameworks

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks provide a way to map objects in an object-oriented language to tables in a relational database.

*   **Java Persistence API (JPA):** A specification that defines how to persist Java objects to a database.
*   **Hibernate:** The most popular implementation of the JPA specification.

## 4. Testing Frameworks

Testing frameworks provide a standard way to write and run tests for your code.

*   **JUnit:** The most popular unit testing framework for Java.
*   **Mockito:** A mocking framework that is often used with JUnit to create mock objects for testing.
