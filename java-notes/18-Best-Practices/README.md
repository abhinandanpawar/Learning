# 18 - Java Best Practices and Code Quality

Writing code that works is one thing. Writing code that is clean, maintainable, and easy for other developers to understand is another. This chapter introduces some of the best practices that can help you improve the quality of your Java code.

## 1. Follow Naming Conventions
Consistent naming conventions make your code more readable. The standard Java naming conventions are:
*   **Classes and Interfaces:** Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `Product`, `Shippable`).
*   **Methods and Variables:** Use `camelCase` (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `productName`).
*   **Constants:** Use `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`).
*   **Packages:** Use `lowercase.with.dots` (e.g., `com.example.ecommerce.products`).

## 2. Write Meaningful Comments
Good code should be largely self-documenting. However, comments are still useful for:
*   **Explaining the "why", not the "what":** Your code shows what you are doing. Your comments should explain why you are doing it.
*   **Documenting public APIs:** Use Javadoc comments (`/** ... */`) to document your public classes and methods.

## 3. Keep Methods Small and Focused
A method should do one thing and do it well. This makes your methods easier to understand, test, and reuse. If a method is getting too long, it's a sign that it might be doing too much and should be broken up into smaller methods.

## 4. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
The DRY principle states that you should not repeat the same code in multiple places. If you find yourself copying and pasting code, it's a sign that you should extract that code into a reusable method.

## 5. Favor Composition over Inheritance
As we discussed in the OOP chapters, composition (having an object as a field in another object) is often more flexible and less coupled than inheritance.

## 6. Program to an Interface, Not an Implementation
This is a core principle of good object-oriented design. It makes your code more flexible and easier to test.

## 7. Use a Linter / Static Analysis Tool
Tools like Checkstyle, PMD, and SonarQube can automatically analyze your code and find common bugs, style violations, and other potential problems. Integrating these tools into your build process can help you maintain a high level of code quality.
