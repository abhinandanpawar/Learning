# 06 - Exception Handling: Dealing with the Unexpected

In a perfect world, programs would always run without errors. Files would always exist, networks would never fail, and users would never enter bad data. But we don't live in a perfect world. As language designers, we had to provide a robust mechanism to handle errors gracefully.

## 1. The `Throwable` Hierarchy: A Family of Problems

In Java, all "problem" events are objects that inherit from the `Throwable` class. Understanding this hierarchy is key to understanding how errors and exceptions are organized.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Throwable {
        +getMessage() String
        +printStackTrace() void
    }
    class Error
    class Exception
    class RuntimeException

    Throwable <|-- Error
    Throwable <|-- Exception
    Exception <|-- RuntimeException

    note for Error "Serious, unrecoverable problems (e.g., OutOfMemoryError). Don't try to catch these."
    note for Exception "Recoverable problems the program should handle (e.g., IOException)."
    note for RuntimeException "Programming errors (e.g., NullPointerException). A subclass of Exception."

```

*   **`Error`:** Represents critical, abnormal conditions that are external to the application and usually unrecoverable (e.g., the JVM running out of memory). Your program should not try to `catch` these.
*   **`Exception`:** Represents conditions that a well-written application should anticipate and can often recover from.

## 2. Handling Exceptions: `try`, `catch`, `finally`

This is the classic mechanism for handling exceptions.
*   **`try`:** You place the code that might throw an exception in the `try` block.
*   **`catch`:** You use a `catch` block to define the "recovery" code that runs if a specific exception is thrown.
*   **`finally`:** The `finally` block is our guarantee that a piece of code will *always* run, whether an exception was thrown or not. This is essential for cleanup tasks like closing files.

```java
public void oldSchoolFileReader(String path) {
    FileReader reader = null;
    try {
        reader = new FileReader(path);
        // ... read from the file ...
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
        System.err.println("Error: File not found at " + path);
    } finally {
        if (reader != null) {
            try {
                reader.close(); // Closing the resource
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // Handle the exception from closing the resource
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
As you can see, the `finally` block can become quite verbose and is itself prone to errors. This led us to design a better way.

## 3. The Modern Way: `try-with-resources`

Introduced in Java 7, the `try-with-resources` statement is the preferred way to handle resources that need to be closed (like files, database connections, etc.). It's safer and much more concise.

Any object that implements the `java.lang.AutoCloseable` interface can be used in a `try-with-resources` statement.

```java
public void modernFileReader(String path) {
    // The FileReader is declared inside the parentheses.
    try (FileReader reader = new FileReader(path)) {
        // ... read from the file ...
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
        System.err.println("Error: File not found at " + path);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // The .close() method can also throw an IOException
        System.err.println("Error closing the file: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    // No 'finally' block needed! The 'reader' is automatically closed.
}
```

## 4. Checked vs. Unchecked: A Design Philosophy

This was one of our most controversial design decisions. We divided the `Exception` family into two categories to guide developers on what they should handle.

*   **Checked Exceptions:** These are for predictable, recoverable error conditions. The compiler *checks* that you have handled them.
    *   **Examples:** `IOException`, `SQLException`, `FileNotFoundException`.
    *   **Rule:** You must either `catch` the exception or declare that your method `throws` it.
    *   **Why?** We wanted to force developers to build more robust applications by thinking about error conditions upfront.

*   **Unchecked (Runtime) Exceptions:** These represent programming errors (bugs) that are generally not recoverable.
    *   **Examples:** `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `IllegalArgumentException`.
    *   **Rule:** You are not required to handle them, though you can if you want.
    *   **Why?** Forcing checks for these everywhere would severely clutter the code. The best "fix" is to write correct code in the first place.

| Type      | When to Use                                       | Example                      | How to Handle                               |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Checked** | For predictable, recoverable, external conditions. | `FileNotFoundException`      | Must `try-catch` or `throws`.               |
| **Unchecked** | For bugs and programming errors.                  | `NullPointerException`       | Don't catch. Fix your code.                 |
| **`Error`**   | For critical, unrecoverable JVM errors.           | `OutOfMemoryError`           | Don't catch. The program is likely to crash. |

## 5. Hands-On Lab: Safe File Reading

To see these concepts in action, we've created a small project in the `code/` subdirectory. It demonstrates:
*   Using `try-with-resources` to read a file.
*   Handling a `FileNotFoundException`.
*   Creating and throwing a custom checked exception.

**To run it:**
1.  Navigate to the `code/` directory.
2.  Run `mvn compile exec:java`. The program will first fail because a file is missing.
3.  Create a file named `sample.txt` in the `code/` directory.
4.  Run the program again to see it succeed.
