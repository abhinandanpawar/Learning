# 04 - Advanced OOP: Interfaces and Abstraction

Now that you understand the core principles of OOP, let's explore some of the more advanced tools we gave you to design flexible and maintainable software.

## 1. Abstraction: The Power of Not Knowing

Abstraction is a powerful concept. It allows you to define a contract without specifying the implementation. We provided two tools for this: abstract classes and interfaces.

### a. Abstract Classes: A Template for a Class

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated. It's a template that other classes can extend.

In our e-commerce app, we might want to have a base `Product` class that has some common functionality, but we don't want anyone to be able to create a generic `Product`.

```java
public abstract class Product {
    // ... common fields and methods
    public abstract void display(); // Abstract method
}
```

### b. Interfaces: A Pure Contract

An interface is a completely abstract type. It only contains method signatures. We designed interfaces to solve the "multiple inheritance" problem that plagues languages like C++. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to wear many hats.

For our e-commerce app, we could have an interface for items that can be shipped:

```java
public interface Shippable {
    double getWeight();
    String getShippingAddress();
}
```

A `Book` could implement `Shippable`, but a `DigitalDownload` would not.

**System Design Insight:** Interfaces are the cornerstone of "loose coupling" in system design. By programming to an interface rather than a concrete class, you can easily swap out implementations without changing the rest of your code. This is a key principle for building flexible systems.

## 2. Packages: Organizing Your Code

As your application grows, you need a way to organize your code. We created packages for this purpose. A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.

For our e-commerce app, we might have packages like:
*   `com.example.ecommerce.products`
*   `com.example.ecommerce.orders`
*   `com.example.ecommerce.users`

This was a simple but crucial design decision to avoid naming conflicts and to make code easier to navigate.

## 3. Enums: Type-Safe Constants

Before Java 5, developers often used integers or strings to represent a set of constants, which was error-prone. We introduced `enum` to create a type-safe way to represent a fixed set of values.

For our e-commerce app, we could have an enum for order status:

```java
public enum OrderStatus {
    PENDING,
    SHIPPED,
    DELIVERED,
    CANCELLED
}
```

This ensures that an order's status can only be one of these four values, which makes the code more robust.

## Interview Deep Dives

### Q15: What's the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface?

*   **Simple Answer:** An abstract class is for creating a base class with some shared code for related classes (an "is-a" relationship). An interface is for defining a contract of what a class can do, without any implementation (a "has-a-capability" relationship).
*   **Detailed Explanation:**
| Feature | Abstract Class | Interface |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inheritance** | A class can `extend` only **one**. | A class can `implement` **many**. |
| **State** | Can have instance variables (fields). | Cannot have instance variables. |
| **Methods** | Can have a mix of abstract and regular methods. | All methods are `public` by default. Can have `abstract`, `default`, and `static` methods. |
| **Constructors**| Can have constructors. | Cannot have constructors. |

*   **Key Takeaway:** Prefer interfaces for defining contracts. Use an abstract class only when you need to share code among closely related classes.

### Q16: Can you have an abstract class with no abstract methods?

*   **Simple Answer:** Yes.
*   **Detailed Explanation:** Declaring a class `abstract` has only one effect: **it cannot be instantiated**. You can't do `new MyAbstractClass()`.
*   **Why do this?** You do this to create a base class that is only meant to be extended. It signals to other developers that this class is a template and should not be used on its own.

### Q17: When and how do you use the `super` keyword?

*   **Simple Answer:** `super` is used to refer to the immediate parent class.
*   **Common Uses:**
    1.  **`super()`:** To call a parent class's constructor. This is the most important use. It must be the first line in a child's constructor.
    2.  **`super.method()`:** To call a parent's method, especially if the child has overridden it.
    3.  **`super.field`:** To access a field from the parent class if the child has a field with the same name.

### Q18: What is Object Cloning?

*   **Simple Answer:** It's the process of creating an exact copy of an object.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  Your class must implement the `Cloneable` marker interface.
    2.  You override the `clone()` method.
*   **Shallow vs. Deep Copy:**
    *   **Shallow Copy (the default):** Copies all fields. If a field is a reference to another object, only the reference is copied, not the object it points to. Both the original and the clone will share the same referenced objects.
    *   **Deep Copy:** Copies everything. If a field is a reference, it recursively clones the referenced object as well.
*   **Caution:** Java's `Cloneable` is considered a bit flawed and tricky to use correctly. Often, it's better to create copies using a **copy constructor** or a **factory method**.
