# 04 - Advanced OOP: Interfaces and Abstraction

Now that you understand the core principles of OOP, let's explore some of the more advanced tools we gave you to design flexible and maintainable software.

## 1. Abstraction: The Power of Not Knowing

Abstraction is a powerful concept. It allows you to define a contract without specifying the implementation. We provided two tools for this: abstract classes and interfaces.

### a. Abstract Classes: A Template for a Class

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated. It's a template that other classes can extend.

In our e-commerce app, we might want to have a base `Product` class that has some common functionality, but we don't want anyone to be able to create a generic `Product`.

```java
public abstract class Product {
    // ... common fields and methods
    public abstract void display(); // Abstract method
}
```

### b. Interfaces: A Pure Contract

An interface is a completely abstract type. It only contains method signatures. We designed interfaces to solve the "multiple inheritance" problem that plagues languages like C++. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to wear many hats.

For our e-commerce app, we could have an interface for items that can be shipped:

```java
public interface Shippable {
    double getWeight();
    String getShippingAddress();
}
```

A `Book` could implement `Shippable`, but a `DigitalDownload` would not.

**System Design Insight:** Interfaces are the cornerstone of "loose coupling" in system design. By programming to an interface rather than a concrete class, you can easily swap out implementations without changing the rest of your code. This is a key principle for building flexible systems.

## 2. Packages: Organizing Your Code

As your application grows, you need a way to organize your code. We created packages for this purpose. A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.

For our e-commerce app, we might have packages like:
*   `com.example.ecommerce.products`
*   `com.example.ecommerce.orders`
*   `com.example.ecommerce.users`

This was a simple but crucial design decision to avoid naming conflicts and to make code easier to navigate.

## 3. Enums: Type-Safe Constants

Before Java 5, developers often used integers or strings to represent a set of constants, which was error-prone. We introduced `enum` to create a type-safe way to represent a fixed set of values.

For our e-commerce app, we could have an enum for order status:

```java
public enum OrderStatus {
    PENDING,
    SHIPPED,
    DELIVERED,
    CANCELLED
}
```

This ensures that an order's status can only be one of these four values, which makes the code more robust.
