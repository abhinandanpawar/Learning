# 22 - Interview & Growth Prep: Leveling Up

Moving from a senior to a principal role is less about knowing more syntax and more about demonstrating impact, influence, and a deep understanding of trade-offs.

## 1. Technical Interview Prep: Beyond LeetCode

**The Principal's Take:** At a senior level, nobody cares if you can reverse a binary tree on a whiteboard. They care if you can design and build a real system.

### System Design Interviews
This is the most important part of a senior/principal interview.
*   **The Process:**
    1.  **Clarify Requirements:** Spend the first 5-10 minutes asking questions. What are the functional requirements? What are the non-functional requirements (scale, latency, availability)?
    2.  **Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation:** Do some quick math. How much data? How many requests per second? This will inform your design.
    3.  **High-Level Design:** Draw the big boxes and arrows. What are the main services? How do they communicate? What kind of database will you use?
    4.  **Deep Dive:** Pick one component and go deep. Design the API, the database schema, or the caching strategy.
*   **Key Skill:** **Articulating Trade-offs.** Every decision you make has a trade-off. "I'm choosing Kafka here for its durability and scalability, but the trade-off is higher operational complexity compared to a simple message queue."

### Coding Interviews
*   **Focus on Cleanliness:** Your code should be clean, well-structured, and easy to read. Use meaningful variable names.
*   **Think Aloud:** Explain your thought process as you code. The interviewer is testing your problem-solving skills, not just your coding skills.

## 2. Professional Growth: Becoming a Force Multiplier

**The Principal's Take:** Your job is no longer just about writing code. It's about making the entire team more effective.

### How to Grow Your Impact:
*   **Write Design Docs:** Before you build any significant feature, write a one-page design document. This forces you to think through the design and allows others to give feedback.
*   **Lead Code Reviews:** Don't just look for bugs. Look for opportunities to improve the design, simplify the code, and mentor other developers.
*   **Own a System:** Become the go-to expert for a particular service or component. Understand its architecture, its performance characteristics, and its operational issues.
*   **Present Your Work:** Give a tech talk to your team or a brown-bag session on a new technology you've been exploring. This builds your influence and communication skills.
*   **Stay Curious:** The tech world moves fast. Dedicate time each week to reading blogs, watching conference talks, and experimenting with new technologies.
