# 09 - IO Streams: Talking to the Outside World

A program isn't very useful if it can't interact with the outside world. We needed a powerful and flexible way for your programs to read and write data, whether it's to a file, over the network, or just to the console. This is why we created the Java I/O library.

## 1. The Decorator Pattern: Our Design Choice

We designed the I/O library around a powerful design pattern called the **Decorator pattern**. The idea is that you can "wrap" one stream with another to add new functionality.

You start with a basic stream (like `FileInputStream` to read from a file) and then you can wrap it with other streams to add features like buffering (`BufferedInputStream`) or the ability to read primitive types (`DataInputStream`).

This design makes the I/O library incredibly flexible and extensible.

## 2. Byte Streams vs. Character Streams

We provided two main hierarchies of streams:

*   **Byte Streams (`InputStream`/`OutputStream`):** These are for reading and writing raw binary data.
*   **Character Streams (`Reader`/`Writer`):** These are for reading and writing text data. They automatically handle the conversion between bytes and characters based on a specified character encoding.

We created this separation because handling text is more complex than handling raw bytes.

## 3. A Common Use Case: Reading a File

Let's say our e-commerce app needs to read a list of products from a CSV file.

```java
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("products.csv"))) {
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        // process the line
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle the exception
}
```

Look at how we've decorated our streams:
1.  We start with a `FileReader` to read the file.
2.  We wrap it in a `BufferedReader` to add buffering, which makes the reading much more efficient.

## 4. `try-with-resources`: A Sanity-Saving Feature

In the early days of Java, developers had to manually close their streams in a `finally` block. This was a common source of bugs and resource leaks.

To fix this, we introduced the `try-with-resources` statement in Java 7. It automatically closes any resources you open in the `try` block, whether the block completes normally or an exception is thrown. This was a huge quality-of-life improvement for developers.

### Q32: What is Serialization, and how do you prevent a field from being serialized?

*   **Simple Answer:** Serialization is converting a Java object into a stream of bytes so it can be saved to a file or sent over a network. You use the `transient` keyword to prevent a field from being serialized.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  Your class must implement the `Serializable` interface. This is a "marker" interface that tells Java your object can be serialized.
    2.  You use an `ObjectOutputStream` to write the object to a byte stream.
    3.  You use an `ObjectInputStream` to read the object back from the byte stream.
*   **The `transient` keyword:** If you declare a field as `transient`, the serialization process will ignore it. This is useful for sensitive data (like passwords) or for fields that don't need to be saved.
*   **Modern Best Practice:** Java's built-in serialization is often brittle and not very flexible. For sending data between different applications or services, it's almost always better to use a standard, text-based format like **JSON**.
