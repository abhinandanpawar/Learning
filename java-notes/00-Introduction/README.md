# 00 - Introduction to Java

## What is Java?

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

## Why Learn Java?

Java is one of the most popular and in-demand programming languages in the world. Here are a few reasons why you should consider learning it:

*   **Object-Oriented:** Java is built on the concept of objects, which allows for building modular programs and reusable code.
*   **Platform Independent:** Java's WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere) principle allows you to write code on one platform and run it on any other platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
*   **Rich API:** Java provides a large and rich Application Programming Interface (API) that includes a vast collection of classes and methods to perform common tasks.
*   **Strong Community Support:** Java has a large and active community of developers, which means you can easily find help and resources online.
*   **High Performance:** With its Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, Java offers high performance for complex applications.
*   **Secure:** Java's security features, such as the Security Manager, make it a popular choice for developing secure applications.
*   **Widely Used:** Java is used in a variety of applications, including web applications, mobile apps (Android), desktop applications, scientific applications, and large-scale enterprise systems.

## A Brief History of Java

Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.

The original motivation was to create a language for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. It was later renamed to Java, from Java coffee, the coffee from Indonesia.

Java has gone through many versions since its initial release, with each version adding new features and improvements. The latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version is Java 17, released in September 2021.
